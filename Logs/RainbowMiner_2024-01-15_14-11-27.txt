*** RainbowMiner Configuration ***


Hints (read them all! It will make entering data much easier):

- press Return to accept the defaults
- fields marked with * are mandatory
- use comma "," to separate list entries
- add new entries to a list, by adding a "+" in front of your input
- remove entries from a list, by adding a "-" in front of your input
- enter "list" or "help" to show a list of all valid entries
- enter "back" or "<" to repeat the last input
- enter "delete" to clear a non-mandatory entry
- enter "save" or "done" to end config and save changes
- enter "exit" or "cancel" to abort without any changes to the configuration


(1) Basic Setup


Every pool (except the MiningPoolHub) wants the miner to send a worker's name. You can change the name later. Please enter only letters and numbers.


Let's start with the local setup of this machine's API.

RainbowMiner can be monitored using your webbrowser via API:
- on this machine: http://localhost:4000
- on most devices in the network: http://DESKTOP-5F4B363:4000
- on any other device in the network: http://192.168.31.211:4000
- it is strongly recommended, that you enable auth and/or restrict access to specific IP-addresses in the following


Do you want to mine to autoexchange pools and earn BTC?
It is easy: Lookup your BTC wallet address and copy it to your clipboard, then press the right mouse key in this window to paste
If you do not want to use autoexchange pools, leave this empty (or enter "clear" to make it empty) and press return


If you plan to mine on Nicehash, you need to register an account with them, to get a NiceHash mining wallet address (please read the Pools section of our readme!).
If you do not want to use Nicehash as a pool, leave this empty (or enter "clear" to make it empty) and press return


You will mine on Nicehash. If you want to see your balance in RainbowMiner, you can now enter your API Key and the API Secret. Create a new key-pair on "My Settings->API key" page, "Wallet permission" needs to be set.


Now is your chance to add other currency wallets (e.g. enter XMR for Monero, ETH for Ethash ...)


Now is your chance to add other currency wallets (e.g. enter XMR for Monero, ETH for Ethash ...)


If you plan to use MiningPoolHub for mining, you will have to register an account with them and choose a username. Enter this username now, or leave empty to disable MiningPoolHub (can be activated, later)


You will mine on MiningPoolHub as Jay0x5. If you want to see your balance in RainbowMiner, you can now enter your USER ID (a number) and the API KEY. You find these two values on MiningPoolHub's "Edit account" page.


If you plan to offer your rig for rent at MiningRigRentals, you will have to register an account with them and choose a username. Enter this username now, or leave empty to disable MiningRigRentals (can be activated, later)


To offer your rig at MRR, you will need an API Key and Secret (each rig should have it's own). Create each pair on MiningRigRentals's "</> API Keys" page.


Choose the region, that is nearest to your rigs (remember: you can always simply accept the default by pressing return):

Region         Valid shortcuts/entries
------         -----------------------

RainbowMiner includes a lot of different miner programs. Before the regular profit switching operation may start,
all programs need to be benchmarked on your system, once. The benchmarks will already mine into your wallet,
but it may take a long time to finish. Please be patient. It is a one time thing.
Note: if you don't care about accuracy and just want to get going, you may switch to a fastlane in the next step.

Please select the benchmark-accuracy. This value will determine the runtime interval used for benchmarks
(this value can be set to individual values by directly changing BenchmarkInterval in config.txt).
- Quick   = 60 seconds (should be enough, for most cases)
- Normal  = 90 seconds
- Precise = 180 seconds

RainbowMiner can track this and all of your rig's status at https://rbminer.net (or another compatible service)
If you enable this feature, you may enter an existing miner status key or create a new one.
It is possible to enter an email address or a https://pushover.net user key to be notified in case your rig is offline.

A new miner status key has been created:
897cd1e3-842f-4f7a-97fd-f13bd483f712
Copy and save or write this down, to access your stats at https://rbminer.net
Do not forget to save your changes, or the key will not be stored into your config.


(2) Select your pools, miners and algorithm (be sure you read the notes in the README.md)


Choose your mining pools from this list or accept the default for a head start (read the Pools section of our readme for more details):
2Miners, 2MinersAE, 2MinersSolo, AccPool, Acepool, Aionpool, AlphPool, BaikalMine, BaikalMinePPS, BaikalMineSolo, Binance, C3pool, CpuPool, Crazypool, DeepMinerZ, DeepMinerZSolo, Ekapool, EthashPool, Ethwmine, Ezil, F2pool, FlockPool, FluxPools, FlyPool, Grinmint, Gteh, Hashcryptos, Hashpool, HashVault, Hellominer, HeroMiners, Hiveon, Icemining, Kryptex, LeafPool, LuckPool, LuckyPool, Luxor, Minerpool, MinerpoolSolo, MinerRocks, Mining4people, Mining4peopleSolo, MiningDutch, MiningDutchCoins, MiningPoolHub, MiningPoolHubCoins, MiningRigRentals, Mintpond, Molepool, MoneroOcean, Nanopool, Neuropool, NiceHash, Pmpmining, PmpminingSolo, Poolin, ProHashing, ProHashingCoins, ProHashingCoinsSolo, RaptoreumZone, Ravenminer, RPlant, RPlantSolo, SeroPool, SoloPool, Sunpool, SupportXmr, SuprNova, unMineable, UUpool, ViaBTC, Vipor, ViporSolo, WoolyPooly, WoolyPoolySolo, ZergPool, ZergPoolCoins, ZergPoolCoinsParty, ZergPoolCoinsSolo, ZergPoolParty, ZergPoolSolo, Zpool, ZpoolCoins

You have entered wallets for the following currencies. Consider adding some of the proposed pools:

Currency pools without autoexchange
-------- --------------------------
DOGE     Pmpmining,PmpminingSolo,unMineable,ZergPoolCoins,ZergPoolCoinsParty,ZergPoolCoinsSolo,ZpoolCoins


Hint: "+entryname" = add an entry to a list, "-entryname" = remove an entry from a list


You are almost done :) Our defaults for miners and algorithms give you a good start. If you want, you can skip the settings for now


(3) Select the devices to mine on and miningmode


Since you plan to mine on AMD, the minimum delay between miner change will be set to 2 seconds



Well done! You made it through the setup wizard - an initial configuration has been created
If you want to start mining, please select to exit the configuration at the following prompt. After this, in the next few minutes, RainbowMiner will download all miner programs. Please be patient and let it run. There will be some popup windows, from time to time. If you happen to click into one of those black popup windows, they will hang: press return in this window to resume operation
