### How to Update

As usual: press [U] to update, or exit RainbowMiner and start "Updater.bat" (or let RainbowMiner do the work, if you have set "EnableAutoUpdate" to 1)

If the automatic update fails for any reason, please do a manual update:
- exit RainbowMiner window
- if exit fails press ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39437538/47248250-56272400-d409-11e8-95d1-33b78d0a8ffd.png) to close the RainbowMiner window
- now start "Updater.bat" (in RainbowMiner directory)
- now restart RainbowMiner

If the manual update failed, too, please go the hard way:
- exit RainbowMiner
- if exit fails close the RainbowMiner window
- download the actual release's zip file (name is like RainbowMinerVx.x.x.x.zip)
- extract the zip file into your RainbowMiner directory, overwriting all files
- now restart RainbowMiner
